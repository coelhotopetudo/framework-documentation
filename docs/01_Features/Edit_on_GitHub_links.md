As you can see on the top of this page, you can add "Edit on Github" links to your pages, this feature can be enabled with a single parameter.

The value has to be the path to the root of your documentation folder in your repository.

In the value you see below, Daux's documentation is in the `docs` folder in the `master` branch.

Daux.io will handle the rest


```json
{
    "html": {
        "edit_on_github": "justinwalsh/daux.io/blob/master/docs"
    }
}
```
